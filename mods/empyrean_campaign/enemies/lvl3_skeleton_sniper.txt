### Section of ranged units behaviour

#It cause shooter to come closer, sometimes.
#Not only if player is out of range, but it's realistic enough --- real shooter would like to come closer, to aim better ;)
chance_pursue=3

#That chance is enough. It can vary, but works nice, as for me
chance_flee= 20

#Just copied that stats from necro-minotaur, assuming they are default
flee_duration=3s
flee_cooldown=1s

#With this setting enemy do shooting from visible area.
#Remember: (threat_range / 2) is hardcoded in standart-behaviour (as for 15.09.2016) as range, closer than which fleeng enemies can't come to hero.
#I was trying different values, and can say, that 10 is surely less than needed (10/2=5 -- very small range)
#and 20 is surely more than needed (skeletons starts shooting even if u do not see them. also it's hard to catch them. really hard)
threat_range = 15

#However, if player came close enough to skeleton, he will not run forever, but will take a fight as a man
#That values are default, so I assume, we do not need them here (but keep in mind -- final config needs that stats)
#melee_range = 1.125
power=melee,164,5

#Following is maximised to let shooter not only flee from one side to another.
#Did not tested lower values, maybe it can be decreased
